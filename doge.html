            Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to
            create a payment system as a joke, making fun of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at the time. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu
            dog from the "Doge" meme as its logo and namesake. It was introduced on December 6, 2013, and
            quickly developed its own online community, reaching a market capitalization of US$85,314,347,523 on May 5,
            2021.
